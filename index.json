Because this remains unexplored in birds, we investigated captive parrots’ perspective of the human-animal relationship. We used a classical separation-reunion paradigm and predicted that variations in parrots ’ facial displays and behaviours would indicate their appraisal of the relationship. The test was divided into three phases of two minutes each: the bird was placed in an unfamiliar environment with a familiar caregiver (union), then the bird was left alone (separation) and finally, the caregiver returned (reunion). The test was repeated 10 times for each bird and video recorded in order to analyze their behaviour. The data show significantly higher crown and nape feather heights, higher redness of the skin and higher frequency of contact-seeking behaviours during the union and reunion phases than during the separation phase during which they expressed long distance contact calls. We observed the expression of eye pinning during the union and reunion phases in one out of five macaws. We argue that variation in facial displays provides indicators of parrot ’s positive appraisal of the caretaker presence. Our results broaden the scope for further studies on parrots’ expression of their subjective feelings.","tags":["emotion"],"title":"Captive Blue-and-yellow macaws (Ara ararauna) show facial indicators of positive affect when reunited with their caregiver","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guillaume Ubiema","Marine Siwiaszczyk","Celine Parias","Roman Bresso","Christophe Hay","Baptiste Mulot","Scott A.

The effects of music and noise have also been somewhat studied in animals, showing different impacts. In this review we aim to illustrate the differences and similarities between animals, in terms of their sensitivity to auditory stimuli (noise or music), by first recalling some generalities about the physical characteristics of sound and the biological bases of hearing. Second, based on the studies reported in this review, we conclude that ambient noise is harmful and/or stressful, and that musical sounds can take many forms with a large range of impacts in animals. Finally, we present two practical examples of the use of music with animals (one in the context of a zoo and the other in cattle breeding) and an example of an experiment designed to understand the impact of music on neonate lambs. These three examples highlight how music can help to improve animal welfare.","tags":["music","vocalization"],"title":"The use and impact of auditory stimulation in animals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marine Siwiaszczyk","Scott A.

Sheep also bleat when they are separated from the flock or stressed in some other way. To us, all these bleats sound very similar. But do you think they also sound similar to the lambs? Or do you think the lambs know whose mother is calling and what they are saying? Scientists try to interpret the bleats of sheep by observing their behavior when they hear these sounds. They study the sound waves of recorded bleats to identify each sheep’s unique voice and even determine which emotions the sheep are feeling. They also investigate the brain to find out what is going on inside the heads of sheep when they hear and understand the sounds of other sheep.

Despite the existence of several structural atlases of avian brains, few of them address the bird’s structural connectivity. In this study, a novel atlas of the structural connectivity is proposed for the male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), aiming at investigating two lines divergent on their emotionality trait: the short tonic immobility (STI) and the long tonic immobility (LTI) lines. The STI line presents a low emotionality trait, while the LTI line expresses a high emotionality trait. 21 male Japanese quail brains from both lines were scanned post-mortem for this study, using a preclinical Bruker 11.7 T MRI scanner. Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed using a 3D segmented echo planar imaging (EPI) pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) sequence with a 200 μm isotropic resolution, 75 diffusion-encoding directions and a b-value fixed at 4500 s/mm2. Anatomical MRI was likewise performed using a 2D anatomical T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequence with a 150 μm isotropic resolution. This very first anatomical connectivity atlas of the male Japanese quail reveals 34 labeled fiber tracts and the existence of structural differences between the connectivity patterns characterizing the two lines. Thus, the link between the male Japanese quail’s connectivity and its underlying anatomical structures has reached a better understanding.","tags":["quail","mri"],"title":"A novel male Japanese quail structural connectivity atlas using ultra-high field diffusion MRI at 11.7 T","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott A.

While lambs are able to discriminate familiar and non-familiar conspecifics (mother or lamb), only lambs reared with their mother develop such clear social discrimination or preference. Lambs reared without mother display no preference for a specific lamb from its own group. Differences in exploratory and emotional behaviors between mother-reared and mother-deprived lambs have also been reported. As these behavioural abilities are supported by the brain, we hypothesize that rearing with maternal deprivation and milk replacement leads to altered brain development and maturation. To test this hypothesis, we examined brain morphometric and microstructural variables extracted from in vivo T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images acquired longitudinally (1 week, 1.5 months, and 4.5 months of age) in mother-reared and mother-deprived lambs. From the morphometric variables the caudate nuclei volume was found to be smaller for mother-deprived than for mother-reared lambs. T1-weighted signal intensity and radial diffusivity were higher for mother-deprived than for mother-reared lambs in both the white and gray matters. The fractional anisotropy of the white matter was lower for mother-deprived than for mother-reared lambs. Based on these morphometric and microstructural characteristics we conclude that maternal deprivation delays and affects lamb brain growth and maturation.","tags":["sheep","mri"],"title":"Maternal deprivation and milk replacement affect the integrity of gray and white matter in the developing lamb brain","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artur Agaronyan","Raeyan Syed","Ryan Kim","Chao-Hsiung Hsu","Scott A.

Investigation into the baboon brain has shed light on the function and organization of the human brain, as well as on the mechanistic insights of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Non-invasive brain imaging, including positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are the primary outcome measures frequently used in baboon studies. PET functional imaging has long been used to study cerebral metabolic processes, though it lacks clear and reliable anatomical information. In contrast, MRI provides a clear definition of soft tissue with high resolution and contrast to distinguish brain pathology and anatomy, but lacks specific markers of neuroreceptors and/or neurometabolites. There is a need to create a brain atlas that combines the anatomical and functional/neurochemical data independently available from MRI and PET. For this purpose, a three-dimensional atlas of the olive baboon brain was developed to enable multimodal imaging analysis. The atlas was created on a population-representative template encompassing 89 baboon brains. The atlas defines 24 brain regions, including the thalamus, cerebral cortex, putamen, corpus callosum, and insula. The atlas was evaluated with four MRI images and 20 PET images employing the radiotracers for [11C]benzamide, [11C]metergoline, [18F]FAHA, and [11C]rolipram, with and without structural aids like [18F]flurodeoxyglycose images. The atlas-based analysis pipeline includes automated segmentation, registration, quantification of region volume, the volume of distribution, and standardized uptake value. Results showed that, in comparison to PET analysis utilizing the “gold standard” manual quantification by neuroscientists, the performance of the atlas-based analysis was at 80 and 70% agreement for MRI and PET, respectively. The atlas can serve as a foundation for further refinement, and incorporation into a high-throughput workflow of baboon PET and MRI data. The new atlas is freely available on the Figshare online repository (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16663339), and the template images are available from neuroImaging tools \u0026 resources collaboratory (NITRC) (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/haiko89/).","tags":["brain","anatomy","baboon","template","segmentation"],"title":"A Baboon Brain Atlas for Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography Image Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karin Petrini","Georgina Denis","Scott A.

By fitting an independent channels model to the data, we found that while the experience-dependent mechanism of audiovisual simultaneity perception is already adult-like in 10-11-year-old children, the task-dependent mechanism is still not. These results indicate that differing maturation rates of experience-dependent and task-dependent mechanisms underlie the development of multisensory integration. Understanding this development has important implications for clinical and educational interventions.","tags":["synchrony","development","audiovisual","face","multisensory"],"title":"Combining the senses: the role of experience- and task-dependent mechanisms in the development of audiovisual simultaneity perception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emilie C.

NF and NO chicks showed significantly longer latencies to touch the food, less time eating and emitted more fear-vocalizations than control chicks. Latency to touch the food was also longer for NO than for NF chicks. Significantly higher densities of c-fos positive cells were present in all the nuclei of the arcopallium/amygdala of NF and NO chicks compared to FF chicks. Also, NO chicks showed higher positive cell densities than NF chicks in the posterior amygdaloid, the intermediate and the medial arcopallium. Exposure to novel food or object induced a similar increase in c-fos expression in the nucleus accumbens and the medial striatum. Our data provide evidence activation of the arcopallium/amygdala is specific of the type of novelty.

Both synchrony and temporal order judgments are commonly used to investigate synchrony perception between different sensory cues and multisensory perception in general. However, extensive behavioral evidence indicates that these tasks do not measure identical perceptual processes. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how behavioral differences between the tasks are instantiated as neural differences. As these neural differences could manifest at either the sustained (task/state-related) and/or transient (event-related) levels of processing, a mixed block/event-related design was used to investigate the neural response of both time-scales. Clear differences in both sustained and transient BOLD responses were observed between the two tasks, consistent with behavioral differences indeed arising from overlapping but divergent neural mechanisms. Temporalorder judgments, butnot synchrony judgments, required transient activation in several left hemisphere regions, which may reflect increased task demands caused by an extra stage of processing. Our results highlight that multisensory integrationmechanisms can be task dependent, which, in particular, has implications for the study of atypical temporal processing in clinical populations.","tags":["fmri","audiovisual","multisensory"],"title":"Overlapping but Divergent Neural Correlates Underpinning Audiovisual Synchrony and Temporal Order Judgments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The project, Functional Neuroimaging of the Vocalisation Perception Mechanisms of Sheep (SheepVoicefMRI), is funded by the French National Research Agency - ANR-20-CE20-0001.\n","date":1518109580,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518109580,"objectID":"94e2540f0149bc62d7b399103fabab32","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/project/sheepvoice/","publishdate":"2018-02-08T18:06:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/sheepvoice/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating the sheep auditory cortex with fMRI","tags":["sheep","mri","fmri","brain","voice","social"],"title":"Sheep Voice fMRI","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A quick(ish) tutorial on how I setup my personal but work related website using Git(Hub), Hugo and Academic on a Mac.

In experiment 1, participants learned three voices over several sessions, and performed a three-alternative forced-choice identification task on original voice samples and several “speaker averages,” created by morphing across varying numbers of different vowels (e.g., [a] and [i]) produced by the same speaker. In experiment 2, the same participants performed the same task on voice samples produced by familiar speakers. The two experiments showed that for famous voices, but not for trained-to-familiar voices, identification performance increased and response times decreased as a function of the number of utterances in the averages. This study sheds light on the perceptual representation of familiar voices, and demonstrates the power of average in recognizing familiar voices. The speaker average captures the unique characteristics of a speaker, and thus retains the information essential for recognition; it acts as a prototype of the speaker.","tags":["voice","identity","experience"],"title":"Familiarity and Voice Representation: From Acoustic-Based Representation to Voice Averages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Damian Marie","Muriel Roth","Romain Lacoste","Alice Bertello","Jean-Luc Anton","William D.

This asymmetric distribution was quasi-identical to that found originally in humans. Such a finding questions the relationship between PT asymmetry and the emergence of language, indicating that the origin of this cerebral specialization could be much older than previously thought, dating back, not to the Hominidae, but rather to the Catarrhini evolution at the common ancestor of humans, great apes and Old World monkeys, 30–40 million years ago.","tags":["brain","mri","baboon","lateralization","evolution","comparative"],"title":"Left Brain Asymmetry of the Planum Temporale in a Nonhominid Primate: Redefining the Origin of Brain Specialization for Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"See this poster on Figshare for some more details.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"c97427401757157a2f237781e1a58190","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/project/sheep-cortex/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sheep-cortex/","section":"project","summary":"See this poster on Figshare for some more details.","tags":["sheep","anatomy","cortex","mri"],"title":"Sheep Cortex","type":"project"},{"authors":["Scott A.

This process, which assumes a good knowledge of the cortex anatomy and a systematic analysis of images, is, nevertheless, sometimes neglected in the neurological and neurosurgical training. This didactic paper proposes a brief overview of the sulcogyral anatomy, using conventional MR-slices, and also reconstructions of the cortical surface after a more or less extended inflation process. This method simplifies the cortical anatomy by removing part of the cortical complexity induced by the folding process, and makes it more understandable. We then reviewed several methods for localizing cortical structures, and proposed a three-step identification: after localizing the lateral, medial or ventro-basal aspect of the hemisphere (step 1), the main interlobar sulci were located to limit the lobes (step 2). Finally, intralobar sulci and gyri were identified (step 3) thanks to the same set of rules. This paper does not propose any new identification method but should be regarded as a set of practical guidelines, useful in daily clinical practice, for detecting the main sulci and gyri of the human cortex.","tags":["anatomy","brain","mri","cortex"],"title":"A practical guide for the identification of major sulcogyral structures of the human cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marianne Latinus","Scott A.

However, findings in the literature have been inconsistent, likely reflecting differences in stimulus characteristics and task requirements. Here, we investigated the effect of task on neural responses to dynamic gaze changes: away and toward transitions (resulting or not in eye contact). Subjects performed, in random order, social (away/toward them) and non-social (left/right) judgment tasks on these stimuli. Overall, in the non-social task, results showed a larger N170 to gaze aversion than gaze motion toward the observer. In the social task, however, this difference was no longer present in the right hemisphere, likely reflecting an enhanced N170 to gaze motion toward the observer. Our behavioral and event-related potential data indicate that performing social judgments enhances saliency of gaze motion toward the observer, even those that did not result in gaze contact. These data and that of previous studies suggest two modes of processing visual information: a 'default mode' that may focus on spatial information; a 'socially aware mode' that might be activated when subjects are required to make social judgments. The exact mechanism that allows switching from one mode to the other remains to be clarified.","tags":["gaze","eeg","face","social"],"title":"Social decisions affect neural activity to perceived dynamic gaze","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aina Puce","Marianne Latinus","Alejandra Rossi","Elizabeth DaSilva","Francisco Parada","Scott A.

We first examine the brain’s sensitivity to gaze direction of others, social attention (as typically indicated by gaze contact), and joint attention. Brain regions such as the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the amygdala, and the fusiform gyrus have been previously demonstrated to be sensitive to gaze changes, most frequently with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neurophysiological investigations, using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), have identified event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the N170 that are sensitive to changes in gaze direction and head direction. We advance a putative model that explains findings relating to the neurophysiology of social attention , based mainly on our studies. This model proposes two brain modes of social information processing—a nonsocial “Default” mode and a social mode that we have named “Socially Aware”. In Default mode, there is an internal focus on executing actions to achieve our goals, as evident in studies in which passive viewing or tasks involving nonsocial judgments have been used. In contrast, Socially Aware mode is active when making explicit social judgments. Switching between these two modes is rapid and can occur via either top-down or bottom-up routes. From a different perspective, most of the literature, including our own studies, has focused on social attention phenomena as experienced from the first-person perspective, i.e., gaze changes or social attention directed at, or away from, the observer. However, in daily life we are actively involved in observing social interactions between others, where their social attention focus may not include us, or their gaze may not meet ours. Hence, changes in eye gaze and social attention are experienced from the third-person perspective. This area of research is still fairly small, but nevertheless important in the study of social and joint attention, and we discuss this very small literature briefly at the end of the chapter. We conclude the chapter with some outstanding questions, which are aimed at the main knowledge gaps in the literature.","tags":["social","gaze","face","eeg","attention"],"title":"Neural Bases for Social Attention in Healthy Humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Phil McAleer","Frank E.

At the neural level, activity in the human motion complex (hMT+) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) has been implicated in this relationship. However, previous neuroimaging studies have largely utilized brief, diminished stimuli, and the role of relevant kinematic parameters for the processing of human action remains unclear. We addressed this issue by showing extended-duration natural displays of an actor engaged in two common activities, to 12 participants in an fMRI study under passive viewing conditions. Our region-of-interest analysis focused on three neural areas (hMT+, pSTS, and fusiform face area) and was accompanied by a whole-brain analysis. The kinematic properties of the actor, particularly the speed of body part motion and the distance between body parts, were related to activity in hMT+ and pSTS. Whole-brain exploratory analyses revealed additional areas in posterior cortex, frontal cortex, and the cerebellum whose activity was related to these features. These results indicate that the kinematic properties of peoples' movements are continually monitored during everyday activity as a step to determining actions and intent.","tags":["biological motion","fmri"],"title":"The role of kinematics in cortical regions for continuous human motion perception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott A.

When the cues come from different sensory modalities these judgments can be used to investigate multisensory integration in the temporal domain. However, evidence indicates that that these two tasks should not be used interchangeably as it is unlikely that they measure the same perceptual mechanism. The current experiment further explores this issue across a variety of different audiovisual stimulus types. Participants were presented with 5 audiovisual stimulus types, each at 11 parametrically manipulated levels of cue asynchrony. During separate blocks, participants had to make synchrony judgments or temporal order judgments. For some stimulus types many participants were unable to successfully make temporal order judgments, but they were able to make synchrony judgments. The mean points of subjective simultaneity for synchrony judgments were all video-leading, while those for temporal order judgments were all audio-leading. In the within participants analyses no correlation was found across the two tasks for either the point of subjective simultaneity or the temporal integration window. Stimulus type influenced how the two tasks differed; nevertheless, consistent differences were found between the two tasks regardless of stimulus type. Therefore, in line with previous work, we conclude that synchrony and temporal order judgments are supported by different perceptual mechanisms and should not be interpreted as being representative of the same perceptual process.","tags":["audiovisual","multisensory","synchrony"],"title":"A Psychophysical Investigation of Differences Between Synchrony and Temporal Order Judgments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Corinne Jola","Phil McAleer","Marie-Hélène Grosbras","Scott A.

However, most neuroimaging studies on AV integration used stimuli of short duration in explicit evaluative tasks. Importantly though, many of our AV experiences are of a long duration and ambiguous. It is unclear if the enhanced activity in audio, visual, and AV brain areas would also be synchronised over time across subjects when they are exposed to such multisensory stimuli. We used intersubject correlation to investigate which brain areas are synchronised across novices for uni- and multisensory versions of a 6-min 26-s recording of an unfamiliar, unedited Indian dance recording (Bharatanatyam). In Bharatanatyam, music and dance are choreographed together in a highly intermodal-dependent manner. Activity in the middle and posterior STG was significantly correlated between subjects and showed also significant enhancement for AV integration when the functional magnetic resonance signals were contrasted against each other using a general linear model conjunction analysis. These results extend previous studies by showing an intermediate step of synchronisation for novices: while there was a consensus across subjects' brain activity in areas relevant for unisensory processing and AV integration of related audio and visual stimuli, we found no evidence for synchronisation of higher level cognitive processes, suggesting these were idiosyncratic.","tags":["dance","fmri","multisensory"],"title":"Uni- and multisensory brain areas are synchronised across spectators when watching unedited dance recordings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Phil McAleer","Scott A.

How to define potential sites of multisensory integration using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently under debate, with three statistical criteria frequently used (e.g., super-additive, max and mean criteria). In the present fMRI study, 20 participants were scanned in a block design under three stimulus conditions: dynamic unimodal face, unimodal voice and bimodal face–voice. Using this single dataset, we examine all these statistical criteria in an attempt to define loci of face–voice integration. While the super-additive and mean criteria essentially revealed regions in which one of the unimodal responses was a deactivation, the max criterion appeared stringent and only highlighted the left hippocampus as a potential site of face– voice integration. Psychophysiological interaction analysis showed that connectivity between occipital and temporal cortices increased during bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. We concluded that, when investigating multisensory integration with fMRI, all these criteria should be used in conjunction with manipulation of stimulus signal-to-noise ratio and/or cross-modal congruency.","tags":["fmri","multisensory","face","voice","social","connectivity"],"title":"Cerebral Correlates and Statistical Criteria of Cross-Modal Face and Voice Integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott A.

Musical actions are over-experienced by musicians and not by non-musicians, and thus offer a unique way to examine how action expertise affects brain processes when the predictability of the produced sound is manipulated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 11 drummers and 11 age- and gender-matched novices who made judgments on point-light drumming movements presented with sound. In Experiment 1, sound was synchronized or desynchronized with drumming strikes, while in Experiment 2 sound was always synchronized, but the natural covariation between sound intensity and velocity of the drumming strike was maintained or eliminated. Prior to MRI scanning, each participant completed psychophysical testing to identify personal levels of synchronous and asynchronous timing to be used in the two fMRI activation tasks. In both experiments, the drummers' brain activation was reduced in motor and action representation brain regions when sound matched the observed movements, and was similar to that of novices when sound was mismatched. This reduction in neural activity occurred bilaterally in the cerebellum and left parahippocampal gyrus in Experiment 1, and in the right inferior parietal lobule, inferior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus in Experiment 2. Our results indicate that brain functions in action-sound representation areas are modulated by multimodal action expertise.","tags":["synchrony","fmri","music","multisensory","audiovisual"],"title":"Action expertise reduces brain activity for audiovisual matching actions: an fMRI study with expert drummers","type":"publication"}]
