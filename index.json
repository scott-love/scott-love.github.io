Both synchrony and temporal order judgments are commonly used to investigate synchrony perception between different sensory cues and multisensory perception in general. However, extensive behavioral evidence indicates that these tasks do not measure identical perceptual processes. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how behavioral differences between the tasks are instantiated as neural differences. As these neural differences could manifest at either the sustained (task/state-related) and/or transient (event-related) levels of processing, a mixed block/event-related design was used to investigate the neural response of both time-scales. Clear differences in both sustained and transient BOLD responses were observed between the two tasks, consistent with behavioral differences indeed arising from overlapping but divergent neural mechanisms. Temporalorder judgments, butnot synchrony judgments, required transient activation in several left hemisphere regions, which may reflect increased task demands caused by an extra stage of processing. Our results highlight that multisensory integrationmechanisms can be task dependent, which, in particular, has implications for the study of atypical temporal processing in clinical populations.","tags":[],"title":"Overlapping but Divergent Neural Correlates Underpinning Audiovisual Synchrony and Temporal Order Judgments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ADD TEXT HERE\nFunded by INRA Department PHASE Crédits Incitatifs 2018 (19000 euros)\n","date":1518109698,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547760185,"objectID":"938eb237d838a317cd3a0ecd886d9483","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/project/phenomathyp/","publishdate":"2018-02-08T18:08:18+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/phenomathyp/","section":"project","summary":"ADD TEXT HERE\nFunded by INRA Department PHASE Crédits Incitatifs 2018 (19000 euros)","tags":["ovine","mri","brain","maturation","pituitary gland","texture analysis"],"title":"Phenomathyp","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ADD TEXT HERE\n","date":1518109580,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547760185,"objectID":"ebbf0cb46d0bab214d4494fff672df33","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/project/neuro2co/","publishdate":"2018-02-08T18:06:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/neuro2co/","section":"project","summary":"ADD TEXT HERE","tags":["ovine","mri","brain","maturation"],"title":"Neuro2co","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ADD TEXT HERE\n","date":1518109421,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547760185,"objectID":"06e83df2cc75116ce2e50abaa23199c7","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/project/prebiostress/","publishdate":"2018-02-08T18:03:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/prebiostress/","section":"project","summary":"ADD TEXT HERE","tags":["ovine","mri","brain","maturation"],"title":"Prebiostress","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" A quick(ish) tutorial on how I setup my personal but work related website using Git(Hub), Hugo and Academic on a Mac.

Yet, the perceptual representation of familiar voices is ill-defined. In two experiments, we explored the neuropsychological processes involved in the perception of voice identity. We specifically explored the hypothesis that familiar voices (trained-to-familiar (Experiment 1), and famous voices (Experiment 2)) are represented as a whole complex pattern, well approximated by the average of multiple utterances produced by a single speaker. In experiment 1, participants learned three voices over several sessions, and performed a three-alternative forced-choice identification task on original voice samples and several “speaker averages,” created by morphing across varying numbers of different vowels (e.g., [a] and [i]) produced by the same speaker. In experiment 2, the same participants performed the same task on voice samples produced by familiar speakers. The two experiments showed that for famous voices, but not for trained-to-familiar voices, identification performance increased and response times decreased as a function of the number of utterances in the averages. This study sheds light on the perceptual representation of familiar voices, and demonstrates the power of average in recognizing familiar voices. The speaker average captures the unique characteristics of a speaker, and thus retains the information essential for recognition; it acts as a prototype of the speaker.","tags":[],"title":"Familiarity and Voice Representation: From Acoustic-Based Representation to Voice Averages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Damian Marie","Muriel Roth","Romain Lacoste","Bruno Nazarian","Bertello Alice","Jean-Luc Anton","William D.

This asymmetric distribution was quasi-identical to that found originally in humans. Such a finding questions the relationship between PT asymmetry and the emergence of language, indicating that the origin of this cerebral specialization could be much older than previously thought, dating back, not to the Hominidae, but rather to the Catarrhini evolution at the common ancestor of humans, great apes and Old World monkeys, 30–40 million years ago.","tags":[],"title":"Left Brain Asymmetry of the Planum Temporale in a Nonhominid Primate: Redefining the Origin of Brain Specialization for Language","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"See this poster on Figshare for some more details.\n","date":1484174506,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547760185,"objectID":"c97427401757157a2f237781e1a58190","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/project/sheep-cortex/","publishdate":"2017-01-11T23:41:46+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/sheep-cortex/","section":"project","summary":"See this poster on Figshare for some more details.","tags":["ovine","anatomy","cortex","mri"],"title":"Sheep Cortex","type":"project"},{"authors":["Scott A.

This didactic paper proposes a brief overview of the sulcogyral anatomy, using conventional MR-slices, and also reconstructions of the cortical surface after a more or less extended inflation process. This method simplifies the cortical anatomy by removing part of the cortical complexity induced by the folding process, and makes it more understandable. We then reviewed several methods for localizing cortical structures, and proposed a three-step identification: after localizing the lateral, medial or ventro-basal aspect of the hemisphere (step 1), the main interlobar sulci were located to limit the lobes (step 2). Finally, intralobar sulci and gyri were identified (step 3) thanks to the same set of rules. This paper does not propose any new identification method but should be regarded as a set of practical guidelines, useful in daily clinical practice, for detecting the main sulci and gyri of the human cortex.","tags":[],"title":"A practical guide for the identification of major sulcogyral structures of the human cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marianne Latinus","Scott A.

However, findings in the literature have been inconsistent, likely reflecting differences in stimulus characteristics and task requirements. Here, we investigated the effect of task on neural responses to dynamic gaze changes: away and toward transitions (resulting or not in eye contact). Subjects performed, in random order, social (away/toward them) and non-social (left/right) judgment tasks on these stimuli. Overall, in the non-social task, results showed a larger N170 to gaze aversion than gaze motion toward the observer. In the social task, however, this difference was no longer present in the right hemisphere, likely reflecting an enhanced N170 to gaze motion toward the observer. Our behavioral and event-related potential data indicate that performing social judgments enhances saliency of gaze motion toward the observer, even those that did not result in gaze contact. These data and that of previous studies suggest two modes of processing visual information: a 'default mode' that may focus on spatial information; a 'socially aware mode' that might be activated when subjects are required to make social judgments. The exact mechanism that allows switching from one mode to the other remains to be clarified.","tags":[],"title":"Social decisions affect neural activity to perceived dynamic gaze","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aina Puce","Marianne Latinus","Alejandra Rossi","Elizabeth DaSilva","Francisco Parada","Scott Love","Arian Ashourvan","Swapnaa Jayaraman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1423409001,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547760185,"objectID":"9bf6a3f340f4270eda3dd9378755e52d","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/publication/puce2015/","publishdate":"2015-02-08T16:23:21+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/puce2015/","section":"publication","summary":"In this chapter we focus on the neural processes that occur in the mature healthy human brain in response to evaluating another’s social attention. We first examine the brain’s sensitivity to gaze direction of others, social attention (as typically indicated by gaze contact), and joint attention. Brain regions such as the superior temporal sulcus (STS), the amygdala, and the fusiform gyrus have been previously demonstrated to be sensitive to gaze changes, most frequently with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neurophysiological investigations, using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), have identified event-related potentials (ERPs) such as the N170 that are sensitive to changes in gaze direction and head direction. We advance a putative model that explains findings relating to the neurophysiology of social attention , based mainly on our studies. This model proposes two brain modes of social information processing—a nonsocial “Default” mode and a social mode that we have named “Socially Aware”. In Default mode, there is an internal focus on executing actions to achieve our goals, as evident in studies in which passive viewing or tasks involving nonsocial judgments have been used. In contrast, Socially Aware mode is active when making explicit social judgments. Switching between these two modes is rapid and can occur via either top-down or bottom-up routes. From a different perspective, most of the literature, including our own studies, has focused on social attention phenomena as experienced from the first-person perspective, i.e., gaze changes or social attention directed at, or away from, the observer. However, in daily life we are actively involved in observing social interactions between others, where their social attention focus may not include us, or their gaze may not meet ours. Hence, changes in eye gaze and social attention are experienced from the third-person perspective. This area of research is still fairly small, but nevertheless important in the study of social and joint attention, and we discuss this very small literature briefly at the end of the chapter. We conclude the chapter with some outstanding questions, which are aimed at the main knowledge gaps in the literature.","tags":[],"title":"Neural Bases for Social Attention in Healthy Humans","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Phil McAleer","Frank E.

At the neural level, activity in the human motion complex (hMT+) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) has been implicated in this relationship. However, previous neuroimaging studies have largely utilized brief, diminished stimuli, and the role of relevant kinematic parameters for the processing of human action remains unclear. We addressed this issue by showing extended-duration natural displays of an actor engaged in two common activities, to 12 participants in an fMRI study under passive viewing conditions. Our region-of-interest analysis focused on three neural areas (hMT+, pSTS, and fusiform face area) and was accompanied by a whole-brain analysis. The kinematic properties of the actor, particularly the speed of body part motion and the distance between body parts, were related to activity in hMT+ and pSTS. Whole-brain exploratory analyses revealed additional areas in posterior cortex, frontal cortex, and the cerebellum whose activity was related to these features. These results indicate that the kinematic properties of peoples' movements are continually monitored during everyday activity as a step to determining actions and intent.","tags":[],"title":"The role of kinematics in cortical regions for continuous human motion perception","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott A.

When the cues come from different sensory modalities these judgments can be used to investigate multisensory integration in the temporal domain. However, evidence indicates that that these two tasks should not be used interchangeably as it is unlikely that they measure the same perceptual mechanism. The current experiment further explores this issue across a variety of different audiovisual stimulus types. Participants were presented with 5 audiovisual stimulus types, each at 11 parametrically manipulated levels of cue asynchrony. During separate blocks, participants had to make synchrony judgments or temporal order judgments. For some stimulus types many participants were unable to successfully make temporal order judgments, but they were able to make synchrony judgments. The mean points of subjective simultaneity for synchrony judgments were all video-leading, while those for temporal order judgments were all audio-leading. In the within participants analyses no correlation was found across the two tasks for either the point of subjective simultaneity or the temporal integration window. Stimulus type influenced how the two tasks differed; nevertheless, consistent differences were found between the two tasks regardless of stimulus type. Therefore, in line with previous work, we conclude that synchrony and temporal order judgments are supported by different perceptual mechanisms and should not be interpreted as being representative of the same perceptual process.","tags":[],"title":"A Psychophysical Investigation of Differences Between Synchrony and Temporal Order Judgments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Corinne Jola","Phil McAleer","Marie-Hélène Grosbras","Scott A.

It is unclear if the enhanced activity in audio, visual, and AV brain areas would also be synchronised over time across subjects when they are exposed to such multisensory stimuli. We used intersubject correlation to investigate which brain areas are synchronised across novices for uni- and multisensory versions of a 6-min 26-s recording of an unfamiliar, unedited Indian dance recording (Bharatanatyam). In Bharatanatyam, music and dance are choreographed together in a highly intermodal-dependent manner. Activity in the middle and posterior STG was significantly correlated between subjects and showed also significant enhancement for AV integration when the functional magnetic resonance signals were contrasted against each other using a general linear model conjunction analysis. These results extend previous studies by showing an intermediate step of synchronisation for novices: while there was a consensus across subjects' brain activity in areas relevant for unisensory processing and AV integration of related audio and visual stimuli, we found no evidence for synchronisation of higher level cognitive processes, suggesting these were idiosyncratic.","tags":[],"title":"Uni- and multisensory brain areas are synchronised across spectators when watching unedited dance recordings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Phil McAleer","Scott A.

These results highlight the influence of both the listener’s experience with hearing an unfamiliar language as well as the speaker’s experience with producing non-native words.","tags":[],"title":"Effects of Experience, Training and Expertise on Multisensory Perception: Investigating the Link between Brain and Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott A.

How to define potential sites of multisensory integration using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently under debate, with three statistical criteria frequently used (e.g., super-additive, max and mean criteria). In the present fMRI study, 20 participants were scanned in a block design under three stimulus conditions: dynamic unimodal face, unimodal voice and bimodal face–voice. Using this single dataset, we examine all these statistical criteria in an attempt to define loci of face–voice integration. While the super-additive and mean criteria essentially revealed regions in which one of the unimodal responses was a deactivation, the max criterion appeared stringent and only highlighted the left hippocampus as a potential site of face– voice integration. Psychophysiological interaction analysis showed that connectivity between occipital and temporal cortices increased during bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. We concluded that, when investigating multisensory integration with fMRI, all these criteria should be used in conjunction with manipulation of stimulus signal-to-noise ratio and/or cross-modal congruency.","tags":[],"title":"Cerebral Correlates and Statistical Criteria of Cross-Modal Face and Voice Integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karin Petrini","Frank E.

Musical actions are over-experienced by musicians and not by non-musicians, and thus offer a unique way to examine how action expertise affects brain processes when the predictability of the produced sound is manipulated. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 11 drummers and 11 age- and gender-matched novices who made judgments on point-light drumming movements presented with sound. In Experiment 1, sound was synchronized or desynchronized with drumming strikes, while in Experiment 2 sound was always synchronized, but the natural covariation between sound intensity and velocity of the drumming strike was maintained or eliminated. Prior to MRI scanning, each participant completed psychophysical testing to identify personal levels of synchronous and asynchronous timing to be used in the two fMRI activation tasks. In both experiments, the drummers' brain activation was reduced in motor and action representation brain regions when sound matched the observed movements, and was similar to that of novices when sound was mismatched. This reduction in neural activity occurred bilaterally in the cerebellum and left parahippocampal gyrus in Experiment 1, and in the right inferior parietal lobule, inferior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus in Experiment 2. Our results indicate that brain functions in action-sound representation areas are modulated by multimodal action expertise.","tags":[],"title":"Action expertise reduces brain activity for audiovisual matching actions: an fMRI study with expert drummers","type":"publication"}]
