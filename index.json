To date, MRI in awake and unrestrained animals has only been achieved with humans and dogs. For other species, alternative techniques such as anesthesia, restraint and/or sedation have been necessary. Anatomical and functional MRI studies with sheep have only been conducted under general anesthesia. This ensures the absence of movement and allows relatively long MRI experiments but it removes the non-invasive nature of the MRI technique (i.e., IV injections, intubation). Anesthesia can also be detrimental to health, disrupt neurovascular coupling, and does not permit the study of higher-level cognition. Here, we present a proof-of-concept that sheep can be trained to perform a series of tasks, enabling them to voluntarily participate in MRI sessions without anesthesia or restraint. We describe a step-by-step training protocol based on positive reinforcement (food and praise) that could be used as a basis for future neuroimaging research in sheep. This protocol details the two successive phases required for sheep to successfully achieve MRI acquisitions of their brain. By providing structural brain MRI images from six out of ten sheep, we demonstrate the feasibility of our training protocol. This innovative training protocol paves the way for the possibility of conducting animal welfare-friendly functional MRI studies with sheep to investigate ovine cognition.","tags":["sheep","mri"],"title":"Sheep (Ovis aries) training protocol for voluntary awake and unrestrained structural brain MRI acquisitions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Artur Agaronyan","Raeyan Syed","Ryan Kim","Chao-Hsiung Hsu","Scott A.

Investigation into the baboon brain has shed light on the function and organization of the human brain, as well as on the mechanistic insights of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Non-invasive brain imaging, including positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are the primary outcome measures frequently used in baboon studies. PET functional imaging has long been used to study cerebral metabolic processes, though it lacks clear and reliable anatomical information. In contrast, MRI provides a clear definition of soft tissue with high resolution and contrast to distinguish brain pathology and anatomy, but lacks specific markers of neuroreceptors and/or neurometabolites. There is a need to create a brain atlas that combines the anatomical and functional/neurochemical data independently available from MRI and PET. For this purpose, a three-dimensional atlas of the olive baboon brain was developed to enable multimodal imaging analysis. The atlas was created on a population-representative template encompassing 89 baboon brains. The atlas defines 24 brain regions, including the thalamus, cerebral cortex, putamen, corpus callosum, and insula. The atlas was evaluated with four MRI images and 20 PET images employing the radiotracers for [11C]benzamide, [11C]metergoline, [18F]FAHA, and [11C]rolipram, with and without structural aids like [18F]flurodeoxyglycose images. The atlas-based analysis pipeline includes automated segmentation, registration, quantification of region volume, the volume of distribution, and standardized uptake value. Results showed that, in comparison to PET analysis utilizing the “gold standard” manual quantification by neuroscientists, the performance of the atlas-based analysis was at \u003e80 and \u003e70% agreement for MRI and PET, respectively. The atlas can serve as a foundation for further refinement, and incorporation into a high-throughput workflow of baboon PET and MRI data. The new atlas is freely available on the Figshare online repository (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16663339), and the template images are available from neuroImaging tools \u0026 resources collaboratory (NITRC) (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/haiko89/).","tags":["brain","anatomy","baboon","template","segmentation"],"title":"A Baboon Brain Atlas for Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography Image Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The project, Functional Neuroimaging of the Vocalisation Perception Mechanisms of Sheep (SheepVoicefMRI), is funded by the French National Research Agency - ANR-20-CE20-0001.\n","date":1518109580,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518109580,"objectID":"94e2540f0149bc62d7b399103fabab32","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/project/sheepvoice/","publishdate":"2018-02-08T18:06:20+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/sheepvoice/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating the sheep auditory cortex with fMRI","tags":["sheep","mri","fmri","brain","voice","social"],"title":"Sheep Voice fMRI","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A quick(ish) tutorial on how I setup my personal but work related website using Git(Hub), Hugo and Academic on a Mac. This is a fairly simple and completely free way to host an academic personal website. The process came from two main sources: 1. The documentation for Academic and; 2. A blog post by George Cushen.\nSo what did I do: I already had Git installed and you will need it too.\nThen install Hugo. There are several options but I used the Tarball method. Full details can be found here but here is a brief description.\nChose install location (e.g., /usr/local/bin), in your executable PATH. Download the latest Tarball for your system to the Downloads folder. Install Hugo in your chosen location. cd /usr/local/bin # CHOSEN_INSTALL_LOCATION # extract the tarball tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/hugo_X.Y_osx-64bit.tgz # verify that it runs ./hugo version Fork the Academic Kickstart repository to your GitHub account.\nLogin to your GitHub account. Click here or search for sourcethemes/academic-kickstart inside GitHub. Click on the fork icon towards the top right of the screen. Clone the repository onto your local system. Note that you need to change \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; to your GitHub username and that My_Website can be changed to any name you want. git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/academic-kickstart.git My_Website Initialise the theme. cd My_Website git submodule update --init --recursive Create your GitHub website repository. On your GitHub page click the “+” icon in the top right corner and choose “New Repository”. Repository name = \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io. Add your \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io repository into a submodule folder named public. git submodule add https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io.git public Add to the local git repository then push to the remote repository. git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit\u0026quot; git push -u origin master Run Hugo to create the HTML for the site. hugo server View the built site in your browser (http://localhost:1313/) but note this is only a local copy and not visible to others.\nUpload the built site to Github for everyone to see @ \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io. Note it will take 2 or 3 minutes to be viewable.\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;build website\u0026quot; git push -u origin master Adding content: OK, the website is built it\u0026rsquo;s time to add content. You can make additions/changes to your website and check out the results before deploying to your actual site.\nA good place to start is the config.toml file in the main directory of your site. It contains a bunch of key-value pairs. change the title value to the title of your website, e.g., your name. Then run Hugo server to create the HTML for the site.\nhugo server View the local copy of the built site in your browser (http://localhost:1313/). Leave the server running and any other changes you make will be automatically visible in local site just created. Go through all the key-value pairs and change, edit or remove any that you want.\nGithub version control: The Host on GitHub page from Hugo outlines a nice way to store all the files of your site on GitHub.\nUpdating the website content: Using the GitHub method above I do not keep a local copy of any of the files. Here is the process I follow to update the website content.\ngit clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;YOUR-PROJECT\u0026gt; cd \u0026lt;YOUR-PROJECT\u0026gt;/ git rm -r public At this point you can make changes to the content of your website and push those to the remote repository.\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;updating content\u0026quot; git push origin master However, this only keeps the content in synchrony with the remote repository it does not update the website.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io.git public ./deploy.sh \u0026quot;comment\u0026quot; The contents of deploy.sh can be seen here\nUpdate academic-kickstart version: I have found updating the academic-kickstart version and subsequently the website to be tricky! Follow the instructions here. However, I was only ever able to update using the ZIP there. Uninstall the current version by deleting the contents of the \u0026ldquo;themes/academic/\u0026rdquo; folder inside \u0026lt;YOUR-PROJECT\u0026gt; and replacing it with the downloaded files.\nAt this point you still need to follow the release notes and update your content and config files to take into account the \u0026ldquo;Breaking changes\u0026rdquo;. If you have jumped a few versions you will need to do this in sequence for each version change (e.g. v3.1 to v3.2 before doing v3.2 to v3.3)\n","date":1518024697,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1518024697,"objectID":"33d571ee6822f89daf3f4badd846a8de","permalink":"https://scott-love.github.io/post/create-this-site/","publishdate":"2018-02-07T18:31:37+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/create-this-site/","section":"post","summary":"A quick(ish) tutorial on how I setup my personal but work related website using Git(Hub), Hugo and Academic on a Mac.
